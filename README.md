## Features

- Download historical stock data using **Yahoo Finance**.
- Predict **next-day stock prices** using **Linear Regression**.
- Predict **future 30-day stock prices** using **LSTM** neural networks.
- Data preprocessing and scaling for better model performance.
- Visualizations of historical prices, predictions, and future forecasts.
